# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

## Project Description

WTWR is a weather-dependent clothing recommendation application that helps users decide what to wear based on current weather conditions. The back end serves as the API and data layer for the WTWR application, handling user authentication, clothing item management, and weather data integration.

### Key Functionality:

- User registration and authentication
- Clothing item management (create, read, update, delete)
- Personalized clothing recommendations based on weather
- User profile management
- Secure API endpoints

## Technologies Used

### Core Technologies:

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment
- **Express.js**: Web application framework
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js

### Development Tools:

- **ESLint**: Code linting for style consistency
- **Nodemon**: Development server with hot-reloading
- **Postman**: API testing and documentation

### Key Techniques:

- **RESTful API Design**: Resource-oriented endpoints
- **Middleware Architecture**: For authentication and request processing
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration management
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure user sessions (to be implemented)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/rudyravelindev/se_project_express.git
   git clone https://github.com/rudyravelindev/se_project_react.git
   ```

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
